# 1 - Predicting Which NBA Rookies Will Become All-Stars
High Level Description
* I'm interested in taking this year's NBA rookie class and predicting which ones are mostly likely to become All-Stars at some point in their careers, based on historical statistical profiles of such players.

Your Approach
* I think this model would be best suited to something like random forests or neural networks. I don't think I'm concerned about what the calculation looks like, mostly instead the input.

How will people interact with your work
* It would give insight into basketball players and their profiles, perhaps statistics that serve as the best indicators. I think I could present data cleanly in notebooks.

What are your data sources
* There are a lot of basketball statistical datasets available, and if necessary I know I can scrape this data off of basketballreference.

# 2 - What's that dog?
High Level Description
* The idea is to make a model that will predict a dog's breed based on a picture of it.

Your Approach
* I think I would have to use neural networks for image prediction.

How will people interact with your work
* Some type of interactive app like a Flask dashboard would be cool. People could upload dog images and the machine spit out a guess.

What are your data sources
* https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification is a site I found. This could also be gathered from Google Images perhaps?

# 3 - What Does a Grammy-Award Winning Album Sound Like?
High Level Description
* The loose idea here is that I would like to take lyrics from albums that have won Grammys and use this to determine what the academy thinks such an album sounds like. Can I detect biases? Maybe I can feed my model albums that were nominated and didn't win?

Your Approach
* This would likely be based around NLP, but I don't currently have a strong enough understanding of that process to further elaborate.

How will people interact with your work
* This could be presented neatly in a notebook.

What are your data sources
* genius.com is a lyric website that I'm pretty sure has APIs. If not, webscraping.
